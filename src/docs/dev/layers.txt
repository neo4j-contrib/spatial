= Layers and GeometryEncoders


The primary type that defines a collection of geometries is the +Layer+.
A layer contains an index for querying.
In addition a +Layer+ can be an +EditableLayer+ if it is possible to add and modify geometries in the layer.
The next most important interface is the GeometryEncoder.

The +DefaultLayer+ is the standard layer, making use of the +WKBGeometryEncoder+ for storing all geometry types as +byte[]+ properties of one node per geometry instance.

The +OSMLayer+ is a special layer supporting Open Street Map and storing the OSM model as a single fully connected graph.
The set of +Geometries+ provided by this layer includes +Points+, +LineStrings+ and +Polygons+, and as such cannot be exported to Shapefile format, since that format only allows a single +Geometry+ per layer.
However, +OMSLayer+ extends +DynamicLayer+, which allow it to provide any number of sub-layers, each with a specific geometry type and in addition based on a OSM tag filter.
For example you can have a layer providing all cycle paths as +LineStrings+, or a layer providing all lakes as +Polygons+.
Underneath these are all still backed by the same fully connected graph, but exposed dynamically as apparently separate geometry layers.
