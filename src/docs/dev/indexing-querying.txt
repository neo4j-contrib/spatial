Index and Querying
==================

The current index is an RTree index, but it has been developed in an extensible way allowing for other indices to be added if necessary.

== Loading and Indexing ==

It is possible to load data into the database and add it to the index during the load.
It is also possible to add existing spatial data to the index later. These are two very different
scenarios, and in fact can lead to different graph structures, so we will explain them each in turn.

To load data directly into the index, the simplest approach is to start by creating a Layer that
suites your data. There are many possible choices built into Neo4j-Spatial, but two common ones
would be:

* SimplePointLayer - an editable layer that allows you to add only Points to the database.
This is a good choice if you only have point data and are interested primarily in proximity
searches. This layer includes utility methods specifically for that case.
* EdiableLayerImpl - this is the default editable layer implementation and can handle any
type of simple geometry, including Point, LineString and Polygon, as well as Multi-Point,
Multi-LineString and Multi-Polygon. Since it is a generic implementation and cannot know about
the topology of your data model, it stores each geometry separately in a single property of a
single node. The storage format is WKB, or 'Well Known Binary', which is a binary format specific
to geographic geometries, and also used by the popular open source spatial database PostGIS.

== Querying ==

=== JTS Queries ===

Neo4j-Spatial contains the 'Java Topology Suite', a library of geometries and geometry operations. In fact, whenever we use the term 'Geometry' we are refering to the JTS class Geometry. Likewise the subclasses of Geometry: Point, LineString, Polygon and others are all from JTS.
This means that you can use all the capabilities of JTS to operate on Geometry instances you obtain from the database. If, for example, you perform a search for geometries in a certain area, you will be able to
iterate over the results and for each geometry returned, call JTS methods on that class. For example, you could call geometry.

But
The spatial queries implemented are:

* Contain
* Cover
* Covered By
* Cross
* Disjoint
* Intersect
* Intersect Window
* Overlap
* Touch
* Within
* Within Distance
