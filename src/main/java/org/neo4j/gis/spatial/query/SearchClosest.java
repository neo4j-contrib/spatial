/**
 * This Search will return the closest objects as found by the

 * the RTree index to filter out objects outside a search window. However, you
 * need to specify a sensible window large enough to include all objects likely
 * to be of interest. Since this depends on your CRS and domain data, we cannot
 * make reliable automatic determinations of the best window size. However, we
 * do provide some alternative constructors to help with this. For example the
 * constructor that takes a buffer and creates a search window by appliying the
 * buffer to the input geometry.
