/**
 * In Neo4j 0.x and even 1.x it was common to not use an index for the starting point of a search.
 * Instead, Neo4j had a single reference node id=0 which always existed
 * and all models could be connected at some point to that node.
 * Finding things was always by traversal.
 * This model was used in Neo4j Spatial, and transitioned to using a special spatial reference node.
 * However, this kind of thinking became more and more of a problem as we moved to procedures in Neo4j 3.0
 * and in particular the nested transaction model of Neo4j 4.0. Since this node was created on-demand
 * even in read-only queries like 'findLayer', it messed with nested transactions where both might
 * try to create the same node, even if the developer was careful to split read and write aspects of the
 * code.
 * <p>
 * It is time to stop using a root node. This class will remain only for the purpose of helping
 * users transition older spatial models away from root nodes.
