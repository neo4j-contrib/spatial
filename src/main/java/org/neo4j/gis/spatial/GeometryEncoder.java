/**
 * Implementations of this interface define custom approaches to storing geometries in the database
 * graph. There are two primary approaches:
 * <ul>
 * <dt>In-node</dt>
 * <dd>This approach makes use of properties of an individual node to store the geometry. The
 * built-in WKT and WKB encoders use this approach, but a custom encoder that simply stored a
 * float[] of coordinates for a LineString would also be classed here.</dd>
 * <dt>Sub-graph</dt>
 * <dd>This approach makes use of a graph of nodes and relationships to describe a single geometry.
 * This could be as simple as a chain of nodes representing a LineString or a complex nested graph
 * like the OSM approach to MultiPolygons.</dd>
 * </ul>
 * Classes that implement this interface must have a public constructor taking no parameters, and
 * should be able to interface to the Layer class using the init(Layer) method. When a new Layer is
 * created, it is a single node that has a property containing the class name of the
 * GeometryEncoder, and if the Layer needs to be read later, that node will be read, and a Layer
 * created from it, and the Layer will create an instance of the required GeometryEncoder, which in
 * turn should be capable of reading and writing all Geometries supported by that Layer.
