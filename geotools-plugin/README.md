# Neo4j Spatial GeoTools Plugin

This module provides integration between Neo4j Spatial and GeoTools. It enables GeoTools-based applications to connect to Neo4j as a data source using the standard GeoTools DataStore API.

## Key Features

- Connect to Neo4j using the Neo4j driver
- Access Neo4j Spatial layers as GeoTools FeatureSources
- Read and write spatial data using the GeoTools API
- Uses Neo4j Spatial Procedures and Functions instead of direct database access

## Usage

```java
Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();
params.put("dbtype", "neo4j-driver");
params.put("uri", "bolt://localhost:7687");
params.put("database", "neo4j");
params.put("username", "neo4j");
params.put("password", "password");

DataStore dataStore = DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(params);

// Access layer as a feature source
SimpleFeatureSource featureSource = dataStore.getFeatureSource("layerName");

// Read features
SimpleFeatureCollection features = featureSource.getFeatures();

// Write features using a transaction
SimpleFeatureStore featureStore = (SimpleFeatureStore) featureSource;
featureStore.addFeatures(featureCollection);
```

## Implementation Details

This implementation uses the Neo4j Spatial Procedures and Functions API to access spatial data, rather than directly accessing the spatial index. This makes it compatible with both embedded and server Neo4j deployments.

The main components are:

- `Neo4jSpatialDataStoreFactory`: Creates connections to Neo4j using the Neo4j Java Driver
- `Neo4jSpatialDataStore`: Manages the GeoTools DataStore functionality
- `Neo4jSpatialFeatureSource`: Reads features from Neo4j Spatial layers
- `Neo4jSpatialFeatureStore`: Adds write capabilities to FeatureSource

## Requirements

- Neo4j (with Spatial plugin installed)
- Neo4j Java Driver
- GeoTools libraries
